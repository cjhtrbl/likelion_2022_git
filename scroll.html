            One, Two, Three,
            One, Two,
            Yesterday it finally came,
            A sunny afternoon,
            I was on my way to buy some flowers for you,
            Thought that we could hide away,
            In a corner of the heath,
            There's never been someone who's so perfect for me,
            But I got over it and I said,
            “Give me something old and red”,
            I pay for it more than I did back then,
            There's just no getting through,
            Without you,
            A bottle of rouge,
            Just me and you,
            Sitting in the garden, I'm a couple glasses in,
            I was tryna count up all the places we've been,
            You're always there, so don't overthink,
            I'm so over whites and pinks,
            I pay for it more than I did back then,
            There's just no getting through,
            Without you,
            A bottle of rouge,
            Just me and you,
            Nineteen Eighty-Two,
            Just me and you,
            There's just no getting through,
            The grape juice blues,
            One, Two, Three,
            One, Two, Three,
            One, Two, Three,
            One,
        </p>

            let scrollTop = lyric.scrollTop;
            let scrollHeight = lyric.scrollHeight - lyric.clientHeight;
            let per = scrollTop / scrollHeight;
            bar.style.width = `${per*250}px`;
